# Open_cv-Color-extraction-filter

This program should have opencv library and webcap or corresponding camera connected.
If you click the color you want to extract from the original image, the color of the area similar to that of the color remains in the resulting image, and the rest of the area is output in gray.

==============================================

I'm sorry, but I haven't experimented with images. Probably not.
